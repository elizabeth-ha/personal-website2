          The presentations were very interesting, especially the aspects about user experience development. As someone who is very interested in visuals and UX/UI, the talks about VR and its future applications were very interesting to learn about. I believe with the further integration of technology, entertainment can be given a whole new definition. And even beyond entertainment, computer graphics has already shown how applicable it is to so many fields. With the advancement of technology, it is exciting to think about what new sorts of adaptations are to come to utilize our continously advancing society.
