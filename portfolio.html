                Titled "Foodie", this was my final project for my Database Implementation class. The project was to create a real life application of user-interface and database interaction. For my project, I decided to make a mock application for restaurant and food search. The user could use the search tool by various categories, such as price range, cuisine, and zip code. In addition, through a password protected section of the application, a user could enter a restaurant or a food dish into the database.
                <br>
                The application was powered mainly by PHP, MySQL, and Python.

                Creating a personal website has been a long term journey for me. I struggled between creating something that represented my personality but also a professional looking website for career related situations. There were a few trial and errors - the first personal website I created was quite... <a href="http://elizabeth-ha.com/portfolio/fruity/" target="blank">fruity</a>. I made that website soon after I joined Avex Designs. I was excited to put the new skills I had learned to use.
                <br>
                However, as time passed, I got a better understanding of site flow, design, and typography. I created version 2, this website, after deciding on a more sophisticated concept and refining my design. I also upgraded the Javascript and jQuery that powers the interactions throughout the site. With my current site, I was able to find a way to showcase my style and also my skills as a web developer.

            <div id="3-content" class="portfolio-content">
              <h2>glory child</h2>
              <p>
                The coding aspect of my Glory Child project mostly concerned the store website. It was fun to be able to take the brand image and create a site that would best showcase it. In addition, Avex Designs had a large amount of fashion clientele, such as Kith and Pony Sneakers. It was helpful to know the ins and outs of ecommerce websites while coding the Glory Child website.

                (The Glory Child site is not currently live since I am hiatus. The link below is just to showcase a part of my code.)

            <div id="4-content" class="portfolio-content">
              <h2>photography website</h2>
              <p>
                This is one of my simplest websites - I created it when I was first practicing my scroll-triggered-javascript code. The emphasis is on the design and the interactions. I think it would be a great website to show off a photography or art portfolio.

                Some projects I am currently working on or would like to work on:
                <br>
                - A library of Javascript/jQuery interactions to help upgrade website professionalism
                <br>
                - Parallax creator: a program where the user to upload layers of PNGs to create a 3 dimensional parallax code that is either interactive with scroll or with mouse movement
