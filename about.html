        <h1>about</h1>
        <p>Hello, my name is Elizabeth - I'm 21 years old and currently a computer science student at New York University, and pursuing a minor in web programming.</p>
        <p>Outside of studying more traditional computer science in school, I have a lot of interest in web development and have worked several web development positions. In the long run, I would love to become a full stack developer.</p>
        <p>Besides computer science, I have a variety of interests and hobbies. I enjoy artistic projects, fashion, going to the gym, travelling, and adventuring for food. I like to live a jam packed life and to always be doing something.</p>
        <p>Someone I really admire is Leonardo Da Vinci. Like him, I strive to become a well rounded person who excels in a wide range of fields. I don't want to limit myself just to computer science, but want to pursue my different interests and bring about a greater product by utilizing my technical skills.</p>

        <h2><a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/" target="blank">NYU Tech</a></h2>
        <p>Currently, I am working as a junior web developer for the NYU tech team. My main duties involve working on the Wordpress platform to build out websites for NYU affiliates. The development process includes working with both the front and back end.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://avexdesigns.com/" target="blank">avex designs</a></h2>
        <p>Avex Designs is a creative digital agency and web design company based in New York City. During my time with Avex as a web developer, I worked on a variety of websites for clients such as
          <a href="http://www.rocawear.com/" target="blank">Rocawear</a>,
          <a href="http://clarkmcdowall.com/" target="blank">Clark McDowall</a>,

          <a href="https://starmountaincapital.com/" target="blank">Star Mountain Capital</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The work I did for clients ranged from creating a website from a blank wordpress to making tweeks and updates to an existing site. In addition, I also added many interactions through Javascript to create more elevated and luxurious websites.</p>
        <p>Outside of programming, I also personally managed a handful of clients. I was in charge of managing communications between the agency and the clients, and fulfilling client requests for site changes.</p>

        <p>Glory Child is a clothing brand I started summer of 2015. It was a small scale project I did just for personal fun and interest. I made approximately $3,000 in revenue and had 2,000+ visitors within the first two days of launch. As a one (wo)man project, I was responsible for everything from designing, to creating the store website, to marketing and management.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am taking a break from Glory Child to focus on school.</p>

        <p>The NYU Peer Undergraduate Mentoring Program is a program at NYU for girls pursuing STEM majors. As a mentor, I'm paired with an underclassman and we meet throughout the school year to discuss a variety of topics. Supporting girls in STEM is something I have always been passionate about and being able to give back to the community has been a very fulfilling experience.</p>
