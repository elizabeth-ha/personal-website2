          <p>Growing up, my parents allowed me to experience many artistic extracurriculars (which I am very thankful for). I grew up in an environment where creativity was encouraged and I got to develop and explore my abilities through different mediums. Here are some projects I have worked on as an expression of my mind and interests.</p>

        <div id="st-blurb" class="life-blurb">
          <p>My background in story writing is a branch off of the Creations block. My mind has always been buzzing with thoughts and ideas and at times while growing up, it became an overwhelming chaos. One method I adopted to better focus that energy was story writing. More often than not, I enjoy writing out the synopsis than a fully fleshed out novel. Overall, I just enjoy bringing the worlds in my head to life on paper.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://avexdesigns.com/" target="blank">avex designs</a></h2>
        <p>Avex Designs is a creative digital agency and web design company based in New York City. During my time with Avex as a web developer, I worked on a variety of websites for clients such as
          <a href="http://www.rocawear.com/" target="blank">Rocawear</a>,
          <a href="http://clarkmcdowall.com/" target="blank">Clark McDowall</a>,
          <a href="http://santinoloconte.com/" target="blank">Santino Loconte</a>, and
          <a href="https://starmountaincapital.com/" target="blank">Star Mountain Capital</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The work I did for clients ranged from creating a website from a blank wordpress to making tweeks and updates to an existing site. In addition, I also added many interactions through Javascript to create more elevated and luxurious websites.</p>
        <p>Outside of programming, I also personally managed a handful of clients. I was in charge of managing communications between the agency and the clients, and fulfilling client requests for site changes.</p>

        <h2><a href="" target="blank">glory child</a></h2>
        <p>Glory Child is a clothing brand I started summer of 2015. It was a small scale project I did just for personal fun and interest. I made approximately $3,000 in revenue and had 2,000+ visitors within the first two days of launch. As a one (wo)man project, I was responsible for everything from designing, to creating the store website, to marketing and management.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am taking a break from Glory Child to focus on school.</p>
